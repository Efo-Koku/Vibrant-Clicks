# Vibrant-Clicks

This a website for a professional photographer based in London. It's a single page site that showcases some of the photographer's work along with a section containing a few paragrahs about the background of the photographer.
The About Me page also details how the photographer became involved in photography and what their style/approach is.

At the top of the page, I have a navbar with the Vibrant Clicks logo to the left and three links that link to their respective sections on the webpage. I have managed to keep this clean and not crowded and the minimalist look continues throughout the site.
Below the navbar is the the image carousel which displays a selection of the photographer's shots mostly in landscape mode and this section is followed by the main Portfolio section which features a collection of more photos, this time in portrait mode. 
Separating the photos in landscape mode from those in portrait mode ensures uniformity which further enhances that clean minimalist feel throughout the site.

The footer, has only two icons, one for sending direct emails to the photographer and the other one serving as a link to the photographer's Instagram account where visitors can see more of the latest photos from the photographer and also to connect with him.
I have used HTML/CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery for this project.
